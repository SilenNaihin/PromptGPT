# PromptGPT

## Description
PromptGPT is a chrome extension that streamlines your creative process when using OpenAI's ChatGPT. Save your favorite prompts, and then easily paste, edit, copy, or delete them as needed. Also supports searching through your saved prompts for quick access.

## Usage
Simply add a prompt using the extension. Then, when on chat.openai.com, click on the desired prompt in the extension to paste it into the chat box. The extension also allows you to easily edit, copy, or delete prompts and search through your list of saved prompts.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Extract the contents and navigate to the `dist` folder.
3. Open Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable the `Developer mode` at the top right.

## Contributing
This project is open-source and I welcome contributions. Please feel free to create an issue or a pull request.

- To get started with development, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- Run `npm run watch` for automatic updates to the `dist` folder as you develop.

## Future Improvements
- Update the feature so that clicking on a prompt doesn't remove the existing text in the chat box.
- Implement the ability to store prompts from an existing chat or title directly in the extension.
- Develop prompt templates that allow for parameter entry directly in the extension.
- Create a shared prompts feature in the cloud for collective creativity.

## Other Information
The extension is currently awaiting approval on the Chrome Web Store. Once approved, it will be available for direct installation.
